# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Introduction
Predicting the survival outcomes of Titanic passengers is a captivating challenge in data science. This project employs machine learning techniques to build a model that accurately classifies whether a passenger survived or perished based on various attributes.

## Approach
1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtain a dataset containing Titanic passenger information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features and create new ones to enhance predictive power.
4. **Model Selection**: Explore classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
5. **Model Training**: Train the selected model to learn survival patterns from preprocessed data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to predict survival outcomes for new passenger data.

## Usage
Clone this repository, install dependencies, preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance to replicate the project's results.
