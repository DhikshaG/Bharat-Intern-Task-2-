# Cat and Dog Image Classification

## Introduction
Classifying images of cats and dogs is an engaging challenge in computer vision. This project leverages deep learning and transfer learning techniques to build a model that accurately classifies images as either a cat or a dog.

## Approach
1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtain a dataset containing images of cats and dogs.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleanse and preprocess the dataset, including resizing images and normalizing pixel values.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Utilize transfer learning by leveraging pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet, or InceptionV3 to extract relevant features.
4. **Model Selection**: Explore deep learning architectures suitable for image classification, integrating transfer learning models.
5. **Model Training**: Train the selected model to learn patterns distinguishing cats from dogs using preprocessed images.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to classify new images of cats and dogs.

## Usage
Clone this repository, install dependencies, preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance to replicate the project's results..
